contact_description: I am a Software Engineer with 6+ years of experience designing and building scalable backend systems, cloud-native applications, and secure APIs. My expertise spans Golang, AWS, and Serverless architectures, with a focus on performance, reliability, and automation. Over the years, I’ve worked on solving complex engineering challenges, optimizing infrastructure, and delivering high-impact solutions that align technology with business goals. I have recently joined Tuskira as a Senior Software Engineer, where I contribute to projects in Cybersecurity and Generative AI. I am passionate about applying my skills to cutting-edge domains, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and continuously growing as an engineer. Outside of work, I draw inspiration from long drives and exploring new places, which keeps me refreshed and creative in my problem-solving approach.
